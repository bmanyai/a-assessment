## Prerequisites
I choose nginx as a reverse proxy due to the following points:
- It is tested and working reliable (many sites based on nginx)
- Suppport HTTP 1.1 and can handle data in JSON format as well
- It has multiple load-balancing strategies (i.e. the round-robin strategy is the default)

For testing puspose I am using a simple Python application, namely a Flask application server.

I am using Docker to run the reverse-proxy and the application as well.

I was working on the Exercise 1 and 2. Unfortunately I did not have time to work on Exercise 3.
