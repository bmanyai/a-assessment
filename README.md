## Prerequisites
I choose nginx as a reverse proxy due to the following points:
- It is tested and working reliable (many sites based on nginx)
- Suppport HTTP 1.1 and can handle data in JSON format as well
- It has multiple load-balancing strategies

For testing puspose I am using a simple Python application, namely a Flask application server.

I am using Docker to run the reverse-proxy and the application as well.
